This document regards the licensing migration and audio libaries used for this project.

It is with the greatest concern for this project to be under the GPL-3.0 licensing, as I believe
it does not fit well with the project. I believe it is for the user to modify and visibility
is for the user, which the original EPL license did quite well (the original license for this
project). 

The reason for this project being under this is the policy of same license under the GPL-3.0
libraries used.

It is time for me crack open the sound libraries and ploogins to make my own Audio Library and
player. This player would be a daemon, and called upon when the Overseer process wants to modify
the current audio stream (play, reset, resume, etc..). However before this gets done, there are still
a lot of things I need to get right before this migration.

[ THIS IS NOT FINAL ]
