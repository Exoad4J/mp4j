Here are a list of bugs or unwanted behaviors throughout the program itself (not external links):

[***] #8 "ResourceFolder managers are not able to create folders, it is able to, but throws errors"
      Detailed Description: A NullPointer & IOException are thrown when the resource folders are not
      found, this could because that the folders are after the propertiesmanager tries to create
      the file.
      Issue Caused: Creating the folders after creating the properties file
      Status: Not looking
      Potential Fix: Remove from static blocks

[***] #7 "Certain symbols in the infoview messes up the html"
  Detailed Description: Some information provided to an AudioInfoEditor will cause it not be able
                        color specific text, especially those featuring a number or other symbol
                        that is not part of the standard ASCII table
  Issue Caused: <font> tag to change the coloring
  Potential Fix: Alternative to using the <font> tag to color text
  Status: Investigating

[!FIXED!] [***] #6 "Incorrect key token for AudioInforEditor Map Key"
  Detailed Description: The static constant for "comment" was changed from "comment" to "comments"
  Issue Caused: Null comments property

[!FIXED!] [***] #5 "Audio Info display does not scroll all the way to the bottom when info exceeds limit"
  Reproduction: Did it with special UTF-8 chars (Japanaese Hiragana)
  Detailed Description: None
  Potential Fix: None
  Status: Fixed

[!FIXED!] [**] #4 "Approve button throws NullPointerException on first click"
  Reproduction: title
  Detailed Description: This has been an ignored bug for a long time, but the main issue is that the approve button's
                        is being returned as null until the following click, which can cause confusion. 
  Potential Fix: Most likely caused by no file being selected in the file chooser
  Status: Fixed

[!FIXED!] [*] #3 "WaveForm animation not acting when frequency too low, and too extreme when frequency too high"
  Reproduction: Play a low frequency audio file and a loud file with a high frequency intensity
  Detailed Description: The waveform under a hardcoded number is unable to determine if the frequency is low and what
                        to do. This action prevents any form of alteration in order to correct the animation so that it
                        will always show up and not be hidden.
  Potential Fix: Calculate the average sum per frame and analyze a certain threshold and apply the threshold average for
                 each vertical line.
  Status: Not started
  Fix: Added an amplitude slider

[***] #2 "ProgressSlider stopping seconds or is misaligned after the music stops"
  Reproduction: Run an audio track until the end
  Detailed Description: The progress slider does not go all the way to the end of the avaliable space once the audio
                        track is reaching the end of the playtime
  Extra Notes: It is noted that it is most often 1 second late, however if tied in with [BUG #1] it is noted that
               there can be much more delay and misalignment.
  Status: Not Started

[***] #1 "ProgressSlider resetting to the wrong spot when audio resumed"
  Reproduction: Literally as the title says
  Detailed Description: The progress slider resumes to the start (0) when the time is resumed thus making
                        it very hard to know where you are once you start.
  Status: Fixing?
