This is a simple project board, where future potential futures will be considered to be added. The more X there is, the more likely it is to be added (max 3)

[XXXX] #9 "UI Buff"
      None
      Status: Investigating

[XXX] #8 "Looping and shuffle controls"
      Detailed Description: Allow toggles for the user to loop the current track or shuffle the contents of the current folder
                              and select a track at random to be played next.

[!IMPLEMENTED!] [XXX] #7 "Extracted Resource Manager"
      Detailed Description: This mechanism enables the program to extract data to a folder that belongs to this program.
                            This program will act by fetching data from this folder and analyzing this data. It should
                            be a program of it's own, instead of embeded within this program. This further allows the user
                            to interact with the program and allow the program to rely less on the binaries itself.

[XXX] #6 "String Dialog Translations"
      Detailed Description: All strings that are displayed to the user should have a separate properties file to have them be
                            defined separately for each individual language avaliable.

[!IMPLEMENTED!] [XX] #5 "Accent Color Options"
      Detailed Description: In the settings menu, allow the user to select a set of accent colors they want.
      Implementation: See #7

[X] #4 "Launch the media player as a daemon and call upon it when need updating"
      Detailed Description: Instead of handling playing music through the Overseer class and having to strain that object. We can
                            launch a media player daemon as a separate program and we interact with it as it goes. However this 
                            can cause points where the daemon continues to play while our main program has froze and other bugs.

[XXX] #3 "JavaDocs for the entire project, this means commenting the code"
      Detailed Description: None, being worked on :)
      Status: Being worked on :D

[XX] #2 "Ability for the user to change the waveform"
    Detailed Description: Have different versions of the waveform animation and let them be useable and
                          changed in the already ongoing feature [#1]

[XXX] #1 "Fill in the gap between the volume slider and the file selector with a board of buttons"
    Detailed Description: This is already being worked on. It is proposed for this section to host a few
                          buttons that will be able to open and lead to other tasks (Settings, etc.).
