# Deprecation of this project and repository
Ok to be fair, this project as a whole is not gone, instead it is being archived, and a new repository is set
up to handle this new project.

This project has seen 2 major releases:<br>
1.0<br>
2.0<br>
These 2 releases were not good, however were able to introduce me to the world of Audio Files with Java.

**Deprecation**<br>
This repository will have its final release published (unstable release) and the repository closed with no more
contribution to it, however, a newer repository will open in order to fill in the position. A clean repository
to start this program as a whole. 

This clean repository will be hosted as 1.0, but will technically be 3.0 (under this repository). It will also
follow a much different doctrine and approach than this program.

**Why?**<br>
This repository contains a program that I have pulled my hair out trying to debug and fix for either end-user
optimizations or to get around certain limitations with Java without having to code a whole new engine or framework.
This caused both loss in time and my inability to improve upon this program properly, making both major iterations
of the program severly crippled and in need of optimizations.

This new slate has newer promises as I have finished implementing a newer audio engine into the newer program.

**Newer Program**
This newer program will be released under the same title "Halcyon" and not "MP4J"; however, code from this original
repository will be referenced and/or used for the other program, if they are deemed worthy. (For example, DeImage, 
PropertiesManager --> all which are polished classes and separate classes that can be used without much
performance loss; generalized utility classes).

*I created this program for fun, but never really expected to walk this far :)*

PS: The README of this repository was never changed and I never plan on changing it, in order to preserve what
I first uploaded to this site as a way to show off my crappy little music player (LOL!)
